# A Minimal Bootstrap 3 Child Theme for OJS 3.1.2

A first step building block towards creating a Bootstrap 3 child theme in OJS 3.

## Does it work?

Absolutely not! My understanding was that a child theme with only index.php, version.xml and the theme's PHP class file that set a parent theme would essentially be a clone of the parent theme. This is clearly not the case, but I don't see anything in the documentation that would suggest what's missing.
